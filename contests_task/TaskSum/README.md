##Conditions

You are given an integer x.
Can you get x by summing some number of 11, 111, 1111, 11111, …? (You can use any number among them any number of times).
For example,
33=11+11+11
144=111+11+11+11

###Input format

The first line of input contains one integer t — the number of input data sets.
The first and only line of each input data set contains one integer x — the number you should get.

###Output format

For each input data set, you should print one line. If you can get x, print "YES" (without quotes). Otherwise, print "NO".
You can print each letter of "YES" and "NO" in any case (upper or lower).
